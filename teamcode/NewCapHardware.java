/**
 * This is NOT an opmode.
 *
 * This class can be used to define all the specific hardware for a single robot.
 * In this case that robot is a Pushbot.
 * See PushbotTeleopTank_Iterative and others classes starting with "Pushbot" for usage examples.
 *
 * This hardware class assumes the following device names have been configured on the robot:
 * Note:  All names are lower case and some have single spaces between words.
 *
 * Joy 1:
 Tank Drive (4 wheel drive with Andy Mark motors)
 Two beacon servos (one with color sensor on it)

 Joy 2:
 2 motors, use tank drive for them
 2 motors independently controlled (4 buttons)
 2 servos (both controlled by same buttons, one forward and one back)
 2 servos (both controlled by same buttons, one forward and one back)

 Can you make all servos for both robots where they donâ€™t go to a set position, but rather you hold and they move tornados that position?
